# Discounting Model Selector (DMS) Simulation Studies
Simulations studies were prepared and executed in order to determine the accuracy of approximate Bayesian model selection methods in the DMS 

Models included:
  - Exponential (Samuelson)
  - Hyperbolic (Mazur)
  - Quasi-Hyperbolic (Laibson)
  - Hyperboloid (Myerson & Green)
  - Hyperboloid (Rachlin)
